                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p><b>Stephen William Hawking</b> was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, 
                    and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the 
                    Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge.
                    Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the 
                    University of Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic 
                    posts in the world.<br>Hawking received numerous awards and honours.Already early 
                    in the list, in 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).At Google's
                    Zeitgeist Conference in 2011, Stephen Hawking said that "philosophy is dead". He 
                    believed that philosophers "have not kept up with modern developments in science", 
                    "have not taken science sufficiently seriously and so Philosophy is no longer relevant 
                    to knowledge claims".He said that philosophical problems can be answered by science, 
                    particularly new scientific theories which "lead us to a new and very different picture 
                    of the universe and our place in it".Hawking himself.Hawkings were composer,
                    physicist, and the science documentary.
